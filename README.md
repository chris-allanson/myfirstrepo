Introduction to Programming for Artists
hooray. Today I actually did some work
Today I explored Unreal Engine and Blueprints
Also experimented with Blender for a potential gaming character


Today I downloaded a tutorial series from Udemy to on programming with C# using Unity 5 2017.  So far I have understood how to navigate the Unity Editor.  

I have understood that it is important when working in the Unity Editor to perhaps change the colours in the preferences settings to indicate clearly when I am in using the Play mode tab.  This should stop me from trying to make changes in this screen that will ultimately be lost as changes made in this screen are not retained and must instead be executed in the Screen mode.
